FAQ! - A.U.R.A. (Artificial Understanding & Response Architecture)

1. What is A.U.R.A.?

A.U.R.A. (Artificial Understanding & Response Architecture) is a modular, biologically inspired cognitive framework designed to create synthetic systems capable of adaptive perception, emotional state propagation, and contextually grounded responses. The public documentation provides high-level architecture and system diagrams, while implementation and internal logic remain private.

2. Can I access the full system code or data?

No. The internal JSON files, prototype code, and experimental implementations are kept private to protect intellectual property and maintain research integrity. Only conceptual diagrams, changelog, and README are public.

3. Can I collaborate on A.U.R.A.?

At this stage, A.U.R.A. is under active internal development. Collaboration is not currently available. Serious inquiries can be considered once the prototype is further along and ready for controlled external review.

4. Can I replicate or build a similar system?

The public files show only the high-level architecture and development history. Recreating the system from these files alone is extremely difficult, as the core algorithms, internal logic, and iterative refinements are not published.

5. Can I ask technical questions?

Yes. Conceptual questions about the architecture or general AI principles are welcome.

Example safe question: “How does the Limbic module interface with memory?”

Example unsafe question: “Can you provide the JSON for memory retrieval?” (will not be shared)

6. How can I stay updated on A.U.R.A.?

Follow the public repository. Updates to README, CHANGELOG, and SYSTEM_DIAGRAMS will be posted there. When new features or prototypes are ready for safe external demonstration, they will be announced.

7. Contact Information

For research inquiries, collaborations, or professional correspondence, please contact the project owner through the repository’s official contact information.

8. General Notes

The purpose of the public repo is documentation and transparency about the system architecture.

All internal files, prototypes, and experimental data remain confidential.

Any misuse or attempts to extract private implementation details is strictly forbidden.
