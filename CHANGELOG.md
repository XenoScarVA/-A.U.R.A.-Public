This file documents the evolution of A.U.R.A. Artificial Understanding & Response Architecture project from
the earliest research and rough ideas all the way to the current, fully modular
Thalamus, Hippocampus, and Amygdala system.

==============================

## [Initial Work Before First Save]
This part covers everything before the first saved version. Most of the work
happened in research notes, rough mental models, and small experiments that
never got saved.

Work done:
- Studied biological limbic systems and emotional regulation.
- Created early sketches of a Thalamus inspired router.
- Ran small Node-RED experiments to test processing concepts.
- Drafted the first ideas for semantic similarity scoring.
- Tried out early emotional state concepts on scratch flows.

==============================

## [0.1.0]
This is the first version that was actually saved as a file. The ground floor of
the entire project.

Added:
- Initial Thalamus flow acting as a basic input router.
- Early event handling logic.
- First ideas about emotional processing (not implemented yet).

==============================

## [0.2.0]
The Thalamus started expanding and became more versatile.

Added:
- More advanced routing logic for multiple input types.
- Branching paths for emotional versus neutral processing.
- Basic UI elements to view incoming data.

Improved:
- Routing reliability.
- Initial logging methods.

==============================

## [0.3.0]
Here the project started taking on a clearer structure.

Added:
- Preprocessing of input signals.
- Normalization of text payloads.
- Early version of a safety check filter.

Improved:
- Naming conventions across nodes.
- Overall organization of the flow layout.

==============================

## [0.4.0]
The Thalamus became more than just a router.

Added:
- Basic emotional variables for testing.
- First prototype of salience scoring.
- Early threat detection logic.

Refined:
- Reorganized routing paths.
- Improved data cleaning.

==============================

## [0.5.0]
This was the moment the project shifted from an experiment into the beginning of
an actual artificial limbic system.

Added:
- First attempt at memory handling.
- Shared history storage.
- Basic grouping of semantically similar inputs.

Improved:
- Thalamus modularization so functions became easier to manage.

==============================

## [0.6.0]
The Hippocampus really started forming here.

Added:
- Source tracking for stored facts.
- Early emotional tagging inside the memory system.
- First working entity similarity scoring.

Refined:
- Better preprocessing in the Thalamus.
- More consistent data structures for memory entries.

==============================

## [0.7.0]
Safety became a serious focus.

Added:
- Input gateway filter to block harmful or malformed content.
- Strike system with thresholds.
- Automatic escalation and lockdown behavior.

Improved:
- Memory formatting and structure.
- Several flow layouts were simplified.

==============================

## [0.8.0]
This is the version where the system finally started to feel alive.

Added:
- Background emotional decay and recovery cycles.
- Mental energy system with natural rises and drops.
- Early salience mapping to determine attention.
- Hooks for emotional memory tagging.

Improved:
- Thalamus routing stability.
- Amygdala responses became more natural.

==============================

## [0.9.0]
The large integration phase where parts began working together smoothly.

Added:
- First complete link between Thalamus and Hippocampus.
- Early Amygdala integration driving emotional reactions.
- Emotional states influencing processing decisions.
- Shared context export structure for upcoming LLM integration.

Refined:
- More predictable similarity scoring.
- Improved consistency of salience values.
- Emotional regulation stabilized.

==============================

## [1.0.0]  Final Save (10 November 2025)
The system reached a fully realized state here. A functional Artificial Limbic
System with three major subsystems working together.

Highlights:
- Fully modular Thalamus, Hippocampus, and Amygdala pipeline.
- Complete emotional state tracking system (arousal, tension, alertness, focus, concern).
- Background regulatory cycles for emotions and mental energy.
- Memory engine with emotional tagging and source attribution.
- Fully integrated semantic similarity engine.
- Complete safety gateway with strikes and lockdowns.
- Clean and polished UI state monitoring panels.
- Architecture prepared for full LLM integration.

==============================

## [1.1.0]  Synapsial Bridge Network Added
A major structural upgrade introducing the communication layer that connects
Entity Extraction and the Memory Engine, allowing the system to finally exchange
information across subsystems.

Added:
- Synapsial Bridge Network acting as a routing and translation layer.
- Two-way communication pathways between Entity Extraction and Memory Storage.
- Basic synaptic nodes for early connection weighting.
- Foundation for dynamic entity-to-memory bonding.
- New routing paths preparing for future semantic refinement.

Improved:
- Entity identification consistency.
- Memory creation logic for new or unknown entities.
- Overall system cohesion between Thalamus → Extraction → Bridge → Memory.

================================

Notes:
This is an early implementation of the bridge. Signal smoothing,
weight stabilization, and semantic reinforcement cycles still need refinement.

## [Unreleased]
Current work in progress.

- Preparing final LLM integration.
- Improving emotional weighting consistency.
- Considering updates to the similarity engine.
- Updating documentation and diagrams.
